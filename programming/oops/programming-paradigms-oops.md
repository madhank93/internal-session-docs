# Types of Programming paradigms

It is a style or way, of writing a program

- **Imperative** in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state

  - **_Object oriented programming_** based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code

    - **data** in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and
    - **behavior** in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

    - Communication with an object is happens by message passing.

- **Declarative** in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
  - **_Functional programming_** It is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, global variables and side-effects.

# Object Oriented Programming

Alan Kay coined the term “object oriented programming” and he is a co-creator of Smalltalk programming language.

### OOP terminologies

- **Class** are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate state (variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (functions or methods).
- **Objects** are instances of classes. An object stores its state in fields (variables) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions).
- Any variable that is bound in a class is a class **attribute**.
- Any function defined within a class is a **method**.

# Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherits the attributes and methods of another class. In other words, child classes gets its attributes and behaviors from parent class.

---

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism - The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms. Using inheritance, objects can override shared parent behaviors, with specific child behaviors. It is of two forms

- Method Overriding (Run time polymorphism)
- Method Overloading (Compile time polymorphism)

---

# Abstraction

It is process of hiding complexities of implementation and exposing simpler interfaces. Hiding internal implementation details and just highlighting the set of services what we are offering is called abstraction.

---

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling of data and methods into a single entity. It is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods)
together as a single unit.
